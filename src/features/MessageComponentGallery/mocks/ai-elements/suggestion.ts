    "Added four tests in signup-form.test.tsx. They cover the empty, invalid and valid states.",
  "Upgrade to Next.js 16":
    "Ran the codemod and bumped next to 16. Two routes needed async params, so I updated them.",
  "Add a loading state":
    "Added a loading.tsx to the dashboard route. It shows skeletons while the data loads.",
